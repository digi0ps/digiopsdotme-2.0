### Previously

I used:
- Django
- Bootstrap
- jQuery
as my stack in my old website ([link](http://digi0ps.github.io)). 
[[source](https://github.com/digi0ps/digiopsdotme)]

It was pretty good, but not so modern in terms of web development. 

### Refactorization
So I refactored it using React and made it into a single page app.
React is pretty neat and impressive. 

Current stack:
- Django + Django REST Framework for API
- React for the client side.

( No major external libraries like jQuery or Bootstrap have been used. )

**Webpack Configuration** - The same as `create-react-app` with some modifications.

**Source Files** - All react files are under `src/react/`.

### Benefits
- Must faster load time.
- Better interface
- Clean animations!

### TODO
- [ ] Animation code right now is very messy. (ReactAnimationGroup, React Motion, GSAP). Need to make it light.
